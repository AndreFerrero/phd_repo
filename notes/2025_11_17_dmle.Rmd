## 1. Idea and Motivation

The goal is to perform estimation on the copula parameter $\theta$. Standard approach in copula estimation would be classical maximum likelihood.

However, standard MLE requires evaluation of the copula density, which in high dimension can be cumbersome or even impossible (d > 220 is not implemented in the copula package for gumbel copula and others).

The advantage of this other approach introduced in Hofert is that it is fast and does not scale bad in high dimensions.

Everything relies on the idea that the diagonal $\delta_{\theta}(u)$ is the distribution of $Y_i = max(U_j)$ for $j = 1, \dots, d$.

An estimator can therefore be obtained by:

\[
\hat{\theta}_n = argsup_\theta \sum_{i = 1}^n log {\delta^\prime}_\theta (Y_i)
\]

For the Gumbel copula, the estimator has even a closed form:

\[
\hat{\theta}_n^G = \frac{log d}{log n - log(\sum_{i = 1}^n - log Y_i)}   
\]

If one takes ${\hat{\theta}_n^G}^* = max(\hat{\theta}_n^G, 1)$, he's guaranteed to have a valid estimator.


## 2. Application to Archimedean copulas (Gumbel case)

The method is easily applicable to Archimedean copulas as their diagonal and its derivative have a simple analytic form:

\[
\delta_{\theta}(u) = \psi_\theta(d \psi_\theta^{-1}(u)) \, , \; \delta^{\prime}_{\theta}(u) = d \psi_\theta^{\prime}(d \psi_\theta^{-1}(u)) {(\psi_\theta^{-1})}^\prime(u)
\]

Once the diagonal has been evaluated in its analytic form, estimation can be performed by optimising the likelihood numerically.

Below we can see a comparison of the estimated parameter for a gumbel copula with increasing observations (K) with d = 12.
